    <h1 class="main_heading" >Our Mission</h1>
    <p>
        At Lesedi Organisation, our mission is to restore dignity and empower young girls by ensuring access to sanitary products and menstrual health education.<br>
         We believe that no girl should miss school or feel excluded simply because of a natural biological process. By addressing period poverty, we aim to break the stigma around<br>
          menstruation and create an environment where girls can thrive academically and personally.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
        Founded in 2018, Lesedi Organisation was born out of compassion and a lived reality. One of our founders reflected on her school years, recalling how a peer <br>
        struggled to access sanitary pads. That experience illuminated a wider problem faced by many girls—period poverty—and inspired the creation of Lesedi Organisation. Since then, we have been<br>
         dedicated to providing practical solutions and long-term support to ensure that every girl has the opportunity to reach her full potential.
