        <p class="fade-in">
            Lesedi Organisation is a non-profit initiative founded in 2018 with a mission to 
            support young girls in schools who struggle to access sanitary pads. We aim to restore dignity, improve school 
            attendance, and empower girls by providing essential menstrual health products and education

            <button class="accordion">Our Mission</button>
            <div class="accordion-panel">
                <p>Lesedi Charity is fully committed to the vital mission of ensuring that no girl misses out on education simply 
                due to the lack of sanitary pads—a situation that constitutes a grave violation of educational equity and dignity.
                 Our commitment goes beyond mere provision; we strive to actively promote awareness around the pervasive issue of 
                 period poverty, thereby restoring dignity to young women and fostering genuine equality within schools across 
                 South Africa. By tackling this fundamental barrier, we empower girls to attend school consistently, confidently,
                  and without shame, allowing them to focus entirely on their studies and secure the brighter futures they deserve..</p>

            <div class="accordion-panel">
                <p>Our vision is to realize a society transformed, one where period poverty is entirely eradicated, ensuring that 
                    menstruation is never a source of disadvantage or distress. We aspire to a future where every young girl, 
                    regardless of her background or economic situation, has equal access to quality education and essential health
                    resources. Ultimately, we seek to free girls from the unnecessary constraints of her menstrual cycle, allowing
                    them to participate fully and confidently in life, securing the opportunity to reach their full academic, social,
                     and personal potential. This vision drives every program, every donation, and every awareness campaign we undertake.</p>

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2018, Lesedi Charity began as a small community initiative driven by simple acts of kindness to support
             young girls struggling to access sanitary products. Recognizing the critical link between menstrual hygiene and 
             educational equity, we formalized our operations, and over the years, Lesedi has grown into a registered non-profit 
             organization impacting hundreds of families across Johannesburg. This growth allows us to provide reliable, essential
              support, demonstrating that our foundation built on those initial small acts has successfully transformed into a 
              sustainable movement creating lasting change and ensuring more girls can stay in school and achieve their full 
              potential..</p>
