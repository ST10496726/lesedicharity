    <!--Project 1-->
    <section class="project">
    <h2> Sanitary Pad distribution</h2>
    <p>We provide free sanitary pads to young girls in schools and underprivileged communities. This ensures that no learner <br>
        has to miss classes due to lack of menstrual products.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>5000 pads distributed since 2018</li>
        <li>12 schools reached</li>
        <li>6000 girls supported</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Menstrual Health Education Workshops</h3>
    <p>We host interactive sessions where girls learn about menstrual health, hygiene practices, and self-care. These workshops <br>
        empower them with knowledge and confidence to manage their periods with dignity.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Peer-to-peer learning activities</li>
        <li>Q&A sessions to break myths and taboos</li>

    <h4>Community Awareness Campaigns</h4>
    <p>To break the stigma around menstruation, we involve parents, teachers, and community leaders in open conversations. By normalizing <br>
        discussions, we help build supportive environments for young girls.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>School and community talks</li>
        <li>Radio discussions and outreach programs</li>
        <li>Partnerships with local leaders</li>
    </ul>

<!--Project 4-->
<section class="project">
    <h5>Reusable Pads & SKills Training</h5>
    <p>We support sustainable solutions by training women and girls to make reusable pads. This not only addresses period poverty but also <br>
        creates small income opportunities.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Eco-friendly and cost-effective products</li>
        <li>Skills transfer and empowerment</li>
        <li>Long-term impact for communities</li>
