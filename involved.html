        <p class="fade-in">Join Lesedi Charity in making a genuine and tangible difference in our communities, because the 
            future success of young girls relies directly on the support we provide today. Every form of contribution acts as 
            a vital resource in our fight against period poverty, ensuring that a girl's menstrual cycle never becomes a barrier 
            to her education. Whether you choose to donate funds which directly provide essential dignity packs and sustainable 
            sanitary supplies, volunteer your time to assist with distribution and empowerment workshops, or simply spread 
            awareness of the critical issues surrounding menstrual equity, every single action counts and is instrumental in 
            restoring dignity, improving school attendance, and ultimately, empowering the next generation of female leaders 
            across Johannesburg. Together, we can turn period days back into school days and illuminate the path to a brighter 
            future for all.</p>
